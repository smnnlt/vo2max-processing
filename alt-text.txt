Fig 1: A line graph, plotting the maximum oxygen uptake normalized to a reference procedure over the processing parameter (i.e. interval length). Three lines represent the median values for the processing strategies moving breath average, moving time average and binned time average, shaded areas around the lines indicate the interval between 10th and 90th percentile. The lines and areas for moving breath and time average are very similar, while the values for binned time averages are systematically lower. The values from all methods decrease with an increasing calculation parameter.

Fig S5: Line plot of respiratory rates over time for all 72 ramp tests. Most tests start with respiratory rates of 20-45, continuously increasing towards 50-70 at the endpoint at 8-15 minutes.
