### Background & Aim

Raw breath-by-breath data is noisy and requires post-processing. Different processing strategies can influence outcome variables, such as the maximum oxygen uptake (VÌ‡O2max). This project provides a systematic mapping of current processing practices and their reporting in the scientific literature. It additionally compares the most common practices on the basis of N = 72 standardized exercise tests.

### Repository Structure

The [scripts](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/tree/master/scripts) folder contains the full analysis scripts for both the scoping [review](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/blob/master/scripts/review.md) and the experimental [comparison](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/blob/master/scripts/comparison.md) of processing strategies.

The [data](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/tree/master/data) folder contains all data from the review (e.g., search results, screening results, extracted data) and from the experiments (raw breath-by-breath data). See the [data-README](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/blob/master/data/README.md) for more details.

The [plot](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/tree/master/plots) folder contains all images generated during the analysis.

The [preregistration](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/tree/master/preregistration) folder lists all documents of the preregistration (also published on the [OSF](https://osf.io/3am4s)).

The [thesis](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/tree/master/thesis) folder contains the bachelor thesis ([PDF](https://github.com/smnnlt/vo2max-processing/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf)) related to this project and its source code.
